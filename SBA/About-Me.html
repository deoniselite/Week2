          What is the Matrix explained? The Matrix is a computer-generated dream
          world designed to keep these humans under control. Humans are kept
          sedated, effectively living a virtual life. Neo awakens in a bed back
          on Morpheus's ship, and Morpheus further explains that one man was
          born into the Matrix with the power to change anything in it

      Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: Taking the red pill, which will reveal the truth about the Matrix, or the blue, 
      which will make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, 
      awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans.

       <h3 class="Beginning">New Beginning</h3> 
        He is then brought aboard Morpheus's flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. 
      As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: 
      In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. 
      After humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind 
      and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, 
      a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, 
      the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.

Nebuchadnezzar: Who Was the Biblical King of Men and Beasts?
It is reported that Nebuchadnezzar's destruction of cities was 
so fierce and the fires were so hot that they turned the limestone buildings into lime. 
Nebuchadnezzar's conquests made him one of history's greatest kings, 
having turned his empire into a powerful force
